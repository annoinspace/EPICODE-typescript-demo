      <div>
        <h3>General overview</h3>
        <p>
          TS is a super-set of Javascript, it helps us finds bugs before we run
          our code. It must be compiled before we can view in our browser. You
          must have knowledge of Javascript to be able to use TypeScript as it
          builds on top of it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The TS compiler</h3>
        <p>
          The compiler configures a Javascript version of our TypeScript code by
          running <strong>tsc filename.ts</strong> in the terminal.
          <br />
          TS compiler helps to convert code written in typescript to javascript
          since the browser and html does not support or understand typescript
          code unless it being converted.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Type Inference</h3>
        <p>
          This is when no explicit type is provided, so an expression is written
          to help TS calculate a "best common type".
          <br />
          This essentially gives you some options as to what the type can be,
          instead of having only one.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The ‘any’ Type</h3>
        <p>Defining a variable as 'any' lets you assign any type to it.</p>
        <p>
          e.g
          <br />
          let anyVar: any = "a string"
          <br />
          anyVar = 5
          <br />
          the 'any' type kind of defeats the purpose of TypeScript since we can
          change the type, but can be used when we need to use multiple types.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Union Type</h3>
        <p>
          This is a great way for us to use multiple types. The union types can
          be signified with --> <strong>|</strong>
          <br />
          e.g
          <br />
          let year: string | number
          <br />
          --> year = 2021
          <br />
          --> year = "2021"
          <br />
          using the union type in this example, both string and number types are
          valid.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Tuple Type</h3>
        <p>
          Tuples are used within arrays, when you want specific types to be
          present in specific spots. If you define these spots, they must be
          filled.
          <br />
          e.g
          <br />
          let arrTuple: [string, number] = ["a string, 5"]
          <br />
          arrTuple: ["a",4] <-- follows the correct order of types
          <br />
          In this array, we will always have a string as the first element, and
          number as the second
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Interfaces in TS</h3>
        <p>
          Interfaces enforce a certain structure of an object, this furthers our
          attempts in keeping code clean.
          <br />
          <br />
          e.g
          <br />
          (we define an interface first with <strong>interface</strong>)
          <br />
          interface PersonInterface {
          <br />
          age: number; <br />name: string }
          <br />
          <br />
          (now using the interface <strong>interface</strong>) <br />let
          aneesah: PersonInterface = {
          <br />
          age: 23; <br />name: "Aneesah" }
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Generics in TS</h3>
        <p>
          Generics are used in instances where you don't know what type
          something is going to be. <br />
          Usually < T > is used in this case, but the T can be replaced with
          anything else. The < T > acts as a placeholder.
          <br />
